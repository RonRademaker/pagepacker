# Contributing

Contributions are **welcome**, will be fully **credited** and much **appreciated**.

You may contribute via Pull Requests or Issues on [Github](https://github.com/RonRademaker/pagepacker).

## Pull Requests

- **One pull request per feature** - If you want to do more than one thing, send multiple pull requests.

- **Be respectful** - Be excellent to other contributors.

## The Future

This package needs work to ensure its quality, therefore I intent to:

- Add **Travis** tp checks all commits and pull requests, everything must pass.

- Start following **[PSR-2 Coding Standard](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-2-coding-style-guide.md)** 

- **Add tests** - to ensure a high quality code base and prevent regression. Code coverage must reach 100%.

## My Promise

I won't promise you I accept all Pull Requests that match the criteria set out above. I do promise you I'll try to help you to fix your problem if your PR doesn't align with my vision for this package or to give feedback on what you created to let it evolve to a quality I believe is good enough.
